# Resume Viewer

## Goal

* Present a resume in a quick to digest fashion which allows the viewer to understand who, what, and how of a person.
* The project will be a public showcase of my development abilities to use in the hiring process.
  * Coding: React, Tailwind CSS, Html, Css,
  * UX: Design, Information Flow, User Interaction
  * Data: Data Analysis, Algorithms
* The project source code should be viewable by others and available for personal use with restrictive licensing to limit commercial use. I need a job after all.
* The project should be hosted on a public domain to allow for easy access and sharing. I will use GitHub Pages for this.
